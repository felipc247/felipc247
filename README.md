# Experience

## School
I studied "Computer science & telecommunications" in ITIS Galileo Galilei in Arezzo, I worked with different languages such as Java, Javascript, Php; I also have experience with HeidiSQL and SqlLite; furthermore I developed some basic Android apps in Java and I'm currently working on my own music player
### Stage 
I worked as a stagist for 2 weeks at Tecnikè (https://tecnike.net/) and 1 week at Ars Automation (https://www.arsautomation.com/) 

## Hobbys

### Piano
I've been playing piano for a while as a self-learner, I do not practice really much, just playing those songs that hit me hard sometimes

### Tennis
I played tennis for a really long time, 8 years in total, I always tried my best, but ended quitting because of a toxic environment where I did not feel welcome

### Videogames
I play videogames frequently, best titles I've played are Tlou, Tlou 2, Horizon (both Zero and West), COD Cold war, also I play a lot mobile games, especially Brawls stars and 60 seconds, in general I like survival games a lot, they are even better if there's some horror influence

### Anime
I watch animes sparely, only watched 3 in the last year, but I do like them a lot, kind of away to escape reality, my favorites are Dragon ball, Bocchi the rock, Onimai I'm now your sister and Spy x family 

### Video editing
I'm currently learning how to use After effects to make cool edits, it's a hobby now but it may turn as a job a day, you can find my edits on my tiktok ❤️
